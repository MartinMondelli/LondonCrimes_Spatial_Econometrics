# LondonCrimes_Spatial_Econometrics
Crimes in London

## Goal
This repository contains the code and data for the spatial econometrics analysis of crimes in London. The analysis focuses on understanding the spatial distribution of crimes and identifying potential factors that contribute to crime rates in different areas of London.




## Important: 
Do not create or use an RStudio Project (.Rproj) for this repository.
When the project is opened as an RStudio project, interactive visualizations generated with mapview may fail to display correctly due to issues with temporary HTML files.
Instead, work with the repository as a regular folder and run the R scripts directly.
